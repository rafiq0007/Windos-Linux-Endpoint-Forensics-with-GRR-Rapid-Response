Windows Linux Endpoint Forensics with GRR Rapid Response
Introduction
GRR Rapid Response is an incident response framework focused on remote live forensics. It allows security professionals to perform detailed investigations on multiple endpoints from a central server. This advanced-level lab will guide you through setting up and using GRR Rapid Response to conduct endpoint forensics on Linux systems, covering installation, configuration, remote data collection, and analysis.

Pre-requisites
Advanced knowledge of Linux operating systems and command-line interface
Understanding of forensic principles and techniques
Familiarity with network and system security concepts
Basic knowledge of scripting and regular expressions
Lab Set-up and Tools
A computer running a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu)
GRR Rapid Response installed
Multiple Linux endpoints for testing (virtual machines recommended)
Internet connection for downloading necessary packages
Installing GRR Rapid Response
Install dependencies:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
Clone the GRR repository:

git clone https://github.com/google/grr.git
cd grr
Set up a virtual environment:

virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install GRR:

pip install -e .
Initialize the GRR server:

grr_config_updater initialize
Exercises
Exercise 1: Setting Up GRR Server
Objective: Install and configure the GRR server for endpoint management.

Configure the GRR server settings:
grr_config_updater set_var --section=Server.server --varname="AdminUI.url" --value="http://localhost:8000"
Start the GRR server:
grr_server --start
Access the GRR web interface at http://localhost:8000 and log in with the default credentials.
Expected Output: GRR server running and accessible via the web interface.

Exercise 2: Deploying GRR Agents on Endpoints
Objective: Install and configure GRR agents on Linux endpoints for remote forensic capabilities.

Generate the GRR client installer:
grr_client_build build --platform linux
Transfer the installer to the Linux endpoint.
Install the GRR agent on the endpoint:
sudo dpkg -i grr-client_*.deb
Verify that the endpoint appears in the GRR web interface.
Expected Output: GRR agents installed and communicating with the GRR server.

Exercise 3: Performing Live Forensics
Objective: Use GRR to collect live forensic data from a remote endpoint.

In the GRR web interface, select an endpoint and navigate to "Flows" > "Launch New Flow".
Choose "File Finder" and configure it to collect specific files (e.g., /var/log/auth.log).
Start the flow and wait for the data collection to complete.
Review the collected data in the GRR interface.
Expected Output: Collected forensic data from the remote endpoint, accessible in the GRR interface.

Exercise 4: Memory Analysis
Objective: Capture and analyze memory from a remote endpoint using GRR.

In the GRR web interface, select an endpoint and navigate to "Flows" > "Launch New Flow".
Choose "Memory Collector" to capture the memory image.
Start the flow and wait for the memory capture to complete.
Download the memory image and analyze it using Volatility:
volatility -f memory.img --profile=LinuxProfile linux_pslist
Expected Output: Memory image captured and analyzed for forensic artifacts.

Exercise 5: Detecting Persistence Mechanisms
Objective: Identify and analyze persistence mechanisms on a remote endpoint.

In the GRR web interface, select an endpoint and navigate to "Flows" > "Launch New Flow".
Choose "ListProcesses" to list all running processes.
Start the flow and review the process list for suspicious entries.
Investigate the startup scripts and services:
grr_client --list_startup_items
grr_client --list_services
Expected Output: Identification of persistence mechanisms and analysis of suspicious processes and services.

Conclusion
By completing these exercises, you have gained advanced skills in using GRR Rapid Response for Windows & Linux endpoint forensics. You have learned to set up and configure the GRR server, deploy agents on endpoints, collect live forensic data, perform memory analysis, and detect persistence mechanisms. These skills are essential for conducting comprehensive remote forensic investigations and responding to security incidents effectively.
